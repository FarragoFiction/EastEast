throwing away react, its really not suited for anything but NorthNorth.  also, im tired of trolling future me, time to escape the maze and start making a new one


this isn't made from a template like create-react-app lets me, that means i did my ts and webpack from scratch

to build, just type yarn build or whatever

BUT , and this is important, it just shoves all the built code into /build

doens't move any assets or index.html or anything. 

so when we farrago transfer its just the whole pile

i kinda like that tbh
