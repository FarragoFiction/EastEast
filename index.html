* style look to be cyber goggles

  *  rip generic rpg maker char sprites, in addition to themed blorbos, rooms should spawn qutodian generic npcs
*when breached, vik should eat ppl. theyre invisible right, filter might be pointless on them
* rejection pronouns are subject not target
* add dateable naga, its censored just like vik. clones itself.  only spawns if bobert breaches
* vik's should have ai to erase nearby people when breached
* physical objects have a filter string (and functions to set and clear them) (just like rooms)
* FRIEND quest for picking up any ARTIFACT
* action to set the filter string of an object
* action to ADD onto the filter string of an object
* action to set the filter string of a room
* action to ADD onto the filter string of a room
* if vik is breached, fuck up the entire room (not just the objects in it)
* action to give someone a copy of the ai beat that this is
* action to give someone a specific ai beat (i.e. flee from the killer)
* theme ai to stop the dating spam
* if witherby is breached, lonely effects on the room and on him
  <ul>

    note to self: comments in the code itsle fshould be parsed to show up in game like in Title:Pending

    * add a few scorpius express characters to the simulation. including dracula and his infinite piss

    * upgrade rabbit hole to also take optional html https://dragcave.net/image/nDqlR.gif -- heralds nam dragon

    e breaching engine (want an action that breaches the target, and then also instead of just changing your graphic breaching copies graphics and ai  and name from a placeholder blorbo (thus innocent can become eye killer))
    * killer: never breaches
* innocent: if killer dies,
* yongki/captain: toggle breach if near a mirror
* twins: living twin breaches if other dies/gets hurt.  unbreaches when cause of death is destroyed
* witherby: never breaches
* camille: breaches if spends too long following the same friend (?)
* ria: breaches if a close friend dies or anyone else breaches
* parker: breaches if goes too long without hydrating (hydration stat would be so funny ngl), unbreaches once hydrated
* vik: can only be hydrated by [redacting] ppl, also breaches if unhydrated (void effect only for breached form)(?)(same for everyone?)
* k , breaches if in same room as peewee for long enough time consequtively
* closer: near fruit
* flower chick: after ten minutes exactly, or one minute after three total  breaches
* tyrfing: if he finds Nidhogg Candy Apple 
* neighbor: never breaches, but you might occasionally see a flash of something wrong with him
*wodin: never breaches, follows killer like an idiot
*wanderer: never breaches, spawns after wodin dies, dies if youve seen a room of each theme
* wanda: breaches if the intern dies
* intern: never breaches
* bobert Robert: never breaches

* twins: hunts and kills cause of death of the other twin
* witherby: never breaches
* camille: headless mode, only her teleporting to the doom works, rest of her ai is gone 
* ria: every object in the same room as her is destroyed, no grave, cannot be revived
* parker:  still shooting ppl but also chanting and moves only in straight lines
* vik: can not be perceived, erases ppl from existence exactly once (no grave, plenty of blood, they can not be revived, even the aibdungeon narration forgets them)
* k: starts killing
* closer: all fruit in game is premptively in her inventory, replaces FRIEND as quest giver
* flower chick: installs skrim mods, fractals for days, plus plenty of gnosis 4th wall breaks, everyone is immortal 
* tyrfing: Hope Event , temporarily ovverrides everyone elses ai with Nidhoggs Will
* neighbor: n/a
*wodin: n/a
*wanderer: n/a
* wanda: super fun happy infinite maze node somehow worse than where you already are, full of gnosis fourth wall breaks
* intern: n/a
* bobert Robert: n/a
*nam/ronin: zap

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
parker story:

standard choice based narrative heavy game where every so often you get to pick between two options

but everything keeps going wrong , usually because the choice you make results in unexpected actions ftom the main char

eventually main char can delve into their own mind in order to seek out their own decision making progress in order to fix it

inside their mind, instead of picking between set options you have finer control, can type commands out

when the char finally finds you, they want to talk, want to blame you , and you can type to them but its clear they cant fully understand you. "why are you telling me "car", i don't want to drive right now, why arent you LISTENING, why did you have me steal that motorcycle"

etc

an ai chat bot where, narratively, the conceit isnt that they are too simple to understand words, but that communication is breaking down between someone and their own executive function

~~~~~~~~~~
GAME IDEA: 

typing game where the words come from a piece of lore fiction or short story, and the words are chosen in successive level by length
slowly over time you start to get ViBes

* BLORBO LIFESIM CARDS PLEASE PLASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE JR NOTE PLEASE DO THIS FUTURE ME OR ANY OF THE MARKED OR UNMARKED PLEASE


* instanely fast mode might be because multiple copies of the same blorbo are in the room at the same time
* devona goes around collecting objects, and if she has an object and sees neville, moves towards him and gives him the object
* neville just vibes, but if he has an object he'll destroy it and ramble about its philosophy in a parody of meaning
* if devona/neville dies the other breaches
* upgrade death system to take a killer as well as a cause of death
* implement  targetIsKillerOfPersonNamedX  for vengence system
* breached devona kills anyone she touches but beelines (slowly) for the killer
* breached neville starts moving around rapidly very quickly but only kills the true target
* flesh out ria and solemn
* continue adding ai and friend quests for all chars

i wonder if im crazy enough to add a leprechaun shipping engine to this
* artifacts should be ripped into custom physical objects so i can control them better.  they can breach between mirror forms and shadow.  their associated user can trigger this
* eggs are no longer objects, they are a blorbo that breaches into a chicken after x time (not ticks)(so they can hatch as soon as you deploy)(so you can crash your game with too many chickens)

    * timeline puzzle from Training's POV?  

    * infinite parking lot (each time you add a member of the ensemble, new layer of music) (dollsim repuprosed to be the ones the Ensemble is recruiting. get ria and ensemble doll parts?)
    * add filters for rooms like east and south (lonely is foggy etc)
    * egg sprite, hotdog spirte , if you put hotdog in light you get secret
    * when looking at an item, you can see its inventory
    * quotidians like picking up objects and putting them in random other objects

    * FRIEND gives out quests (find object with name of X, or theme of Y for example and bring to Quotidian with name of X (try to start shit))
    if you enter unknown command, quotidians remember it and ask you about it
    specifically quotidians, not blorbos
    *if current room in maze changes, unattach all blorbos from it
* maze has list of all possible blorbos. when room changes, if it shares their theme, spawn them in it if they aren't dead
* quest giver, text only. asks you to obtain a Physical Object with certain traits in exchange for something useful. its just FRIEND
* if someone is within range of the Killer, they die
* eye killer runs away from everyone, unless someone gets too close, then they pursue
* add jr, jr only does gigglesnort in response to triggers (for example commenting on specific blorbos)
* if peewee dies, entire simulation resets (just flat out refresh the page)
* can put a physical object into your inventory (renderse it on the ai dungeon section)
* can take it back out of your inventory
* can use physical object on thing (cause reaction in blorbo?)
* stability levels and breech conditions
 
    * spawn the eye killer who flees AWAY (follow but negative?) from anyone and kills if anything touches her
    * if anything get too close she switches to chasing them
*wasd controls for peewee, anything he touches he purloinds

    * quotidians optionally have  a breach state with different art assets and AI (camille has no head or is just a head for example)
    * breaches happen if STABILITY COUNTER reaches zero
    * each quotidian has custom triggers that LOWER or RAISE their STABILITY COUNTER
    * eye killer doens't breech but innocent will turn into eye killer if eye killer is dead
    *if one of the twins dies, if the other is spawned, it Breaches (if its not it spawns AND breaches)

    *use window.errorCount to increase glitches and fractals

    stretch goal: keikaku sim.  For each action, create a simulation of what the world would look like after that action is taken.
    instead of picking a beat at random, or in order of priority, prefer beats that increase the amount of beats that can happen next turn
    (aka, the ones whose actions trigger actions next tick. )

    example:  eye killer wishes to kill The Cultist.  To do this, she must first pick the "follow cultist" story beat, 
    to get close enough to then pick the "stab in melee range" beat

    this would also mean that blorbos have simulations of the world that represent their goal states.

    i'd need to make mini simulation objects so that the world and the blorbos don't need to have graphics (good for testing, too)



    like not for broadcast, but for radio? editing radio stream to add ads and takes?


    * if a room gets replaced (incl north) set the blorbos in it free
    * once processed, audio plays constantly, going in and out of volume, usually muted, sometimes almost unhearable,
    sometimes going up to full volume
    * and importantly, sometimes switching which of the files its looping

    * when enter a new room, chance any free blorbos will be there
    *peewee has a reaction storybeat where if he's close to an object he'll comment on it in some way. (looks X, smells
    X, tastes X, etc.)
    * mary king with her trecherous permit

    fractal rooms and fractal ai
    *find room for truth
    * find someway to link to //0: http://farragofiction.com/ParkerLotLost/

    * the longer you play, the more fractal things get, the more chaotic, till eventually the Merciful Nightingale
    spawns.

    * LONG TERM TODO spawn the eye killer who flees AWAY from peewee and kills if anything touches her
    * allow rooms nearby to tick, even if they aren't rendered. any tick originated from a neighbor room should mark
    itself as such on screen.
    (yes this means that blorbos may move through doors that don't exist in their rooms just because they DO exist in
    peewees, or interact with peewee's room in a weird ghost way. this is fine)



    * attic has protojrs
    *narratr is truth, obvs
    * why do some rooms lead to themselves?
    *
    * add a weird non-puppet peewee that doens't listen (bug i found) (arm2 peewee)

    * begin writing basic trigger/effect ai system so quotidians can randomly cycle between moving randomly, approaching
    peewee, and fleeing to doors

    * reaction system for peewee where he gets a lil ai of his own

    * peewee can pick up objects, has inventory you can check (visual , grid of icons of things he's picked up)

    * special effects if you grab an Artifact



    ** fractal spiraling graphic of the arms of Zampanio, possibly as part of the Attic for East East
    like practical guide to evil, AI can have IMPORTANT GOAL CARDS that they will 100% do if possible (things that lead
    to Plot). but all their other lil ai stuff might fuck with
    <li>* fractal spiraling graphic of the arms of Zampanio, possibly as part of the Attic for East East
    </li>

    <li>simple trigger effect ai engine , like quest engine. first trigger is "entity is in combat range" and first
      effect is "quip". (if a quotidian bumps into anything it comments on it) has a human readable version of trigger
      and effect, plus flavor for both (like quest engine) </li>
    <li>* pull in eye killers assets, render her on screen, she kills anything that gets close, but otherwise doens't
      move</li>
    <li>simple objects, same format as east (triggers are looking for words in either flavor text or name)</li>
    <li>quotidians move randomly, picking up objects</li>
    <li>StoryEngine, much like MazeStorySim. When an effect triggers, print out trigger/effect pair plus flavor text
      much like Quest engine. </li>
    <li>peewee is an ai like any other, but player issues commands. like "go north" or "go to bird", much like
      ThisIsAGame. or ai dungeon.</li>
    <li>peewees ai is STRICTLY for being sassy. popovers complaining about things, for example.</li>
  </ul>
