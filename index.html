  <ul>

    * add trigger and StoryBeat system
    *peewee has a reaction storybeat where if he's close to an object he'll comment on it in some way. (looks X, smells X, tastes X, etc.)

    * * (might not need new action, can MoveToSpecificEle, confirm it works even if peewee moves)
    * new trigger: target farther away than X 
    * new action, deploy sass  (ask your subject blorbo for a scathing insult, put ">:(" in sass bubble and insult in narrative)
    * set quotidians up so if peewee is far away, set movement alg to move towards him, and if they are close to him they sass him


    * LONG TERM TODO spawn the eye killer who flees AWAY from peewee and kills if anything touches her




    *narratr is truth, obvs
    * why do some rooms lead to themselves?
    * 
    * add a weird non-puppet peewee that doens't listen (bug i found) (arm2 peewee)

    * begin writing basic trigger/effect ai system so quotidians can randomly cycle between moving randomly, approaching
    peewee, and fleeing to doors

    * reaction system for peewee where he gets a lil ai of his own

    * peewee can pick up objects, has inventory you can check (visual , grid of icons of things he's picked up)

    * special effects if you grab an Artifact



    ** fractal spiraling graphic of the arms of Zampanio, possibly as part of the Attic for East East
    like practical guide to evil, AI can have IMPORTANT GOAL CARDS that they will 100% do if possible (things that lead
    to Plot). but all their other lil ai stuff might fuck with
    <li>* fractal spiraling graphic of the arms of Zampanio, possibly as part of the Attic for East East
    </li>

    <li>simple trigger effect ai engine , like quest engine. first trigger is "entity is in combat range" and first
      effect is "quip". (if a quotidian bumps into anything it comments on it) has a human readable version of trigger
      and effect, plus flavor for both (like quest engine) </li>
    <li>* pull in eye killers assets, render her on screen, she kills anything that gets close, but otherwise doens't
      move</li>
    <li>simple objects, same format as east (triggers are looking for words in either flavor text or name)</li>
    <li>quotidians move randomly, picking up objects</li>
    <li>StoryEngine, much like MazeStorySim. When an effect triggers, print out trigger/effect pair plus flavor text
      much like Quest engine. </li>
    <li>peewee is an ai like any other, but player issues commands. like "go north" or "go to bird", much like
      ThisIsAGame. or ai dungeon.</li>
    <li>peewees ai is STRICTLY for being sassy. popovers complaining about things, for example.</li>
