    What I love the most about the blorbos is that.  They, all of them, have trauma in their pasts.

    Things that are hard to get over.

    When the training team first came to the Echidna they couldn't even watch media because everything, EVERYTHING had bad memories.

    But here is a Truth.

    This too, shall pass.

    You can get better. 

    Things can get better.

    There is always reason to hope.

    Always.

    The blorbos support each other and rest and recover and learn to care again.

    No matter how deep they seem to be sunk into their problems, their fears, their bad habits. 

    It's okay if everything feels too much right now.

    All you need to do is survive.
