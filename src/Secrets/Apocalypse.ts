        But I'm getting distracted! You realized you could outright hack your local storage! (Mind Powers!) (I added that previous lil bit cuz i find it so fucking funny that the typing mini game says "this area does hack your" and adding "mind" after is just choice) But that wasn't enough for you, now was it. You had to see how far you could push it.  Now, GRANTED, I DID ask you to do this, now didn't I?

        Oh right, I'll need to undo your hacking or you'll kinda never see the full text of this. Thems the breaks!

        But I'm so hella excited! You did it! You really did it!!!  Actually...  I'm not sure what over punctuating would do to this???

        Lets find out together.

        But yeah, how are you liking East East so far?  Or my humble lil branch of Zampanio in general? Does it Inspire anything in you? Do you want to create?  I'd love seeing any and all fan works. Teach yourself how A03 works. Or programming! Write! Draw! Record what you've seen for Those Who Come After!

        Zampanio feeds on our attention. It colonizes our minds. 

        Feed it.
