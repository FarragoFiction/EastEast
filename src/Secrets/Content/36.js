* JR NOTE: PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT DOC SLAUGHTER IS FROM ANOTHER (MORE PARANOID) UNIVERSE, AND THAT THOSE WRITING HER ARE NOT ACTUALLY LICENSED PSYCHOTHERAPISTS. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER OPINIONS AS FACTS. 

Additional Notes: 

It must be noted that certain of my patients are in various stages of recovery from Shared Generational Trauma stemming from their home universe. Camille, Devona, Ria, Neville, and Witherby self identify as having been direct coworkers in a Training Team, Vik, K, Yongki, and Captain identify as direct workers in an Information Team, and Parker is the sole surviving member of Control.

These teams were assembled in the service of a Nightmarish Corporation which by All Accounts sought to benefit from Employee Trauma associated with Containing Horrors. 

It is Important to Keep This In Mind while directing Treatment, especially given the prevalence of formerly useful Defensive Mechanisms no longer being Helpful in their New Environment.
