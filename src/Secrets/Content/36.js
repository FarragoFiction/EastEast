* JR NOTE: PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT DOC SLAUGHTER IS FROM ANOTHER (MORE PARANOID) UNIVERSE, AND THAT THOSE WRITING HER ARE NOT ACTUALLY LICENSED PSYCHOTHERAPISTS. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER OPINIONS AS FACTS. 

Additional Notes: 

It must be noted that certain of my patients are in various stages of recovery from Shared Generational Trauma stemming from their home universe. Camille, Devona, Ria, Neville, and Witherby self identify as having been direct coworkers in a Training Team, Vik, K, Yongki, and Captain identify as direct workers in an Information Team, and Parker is the sole surviving member of Control.

These teams were assembled in the service of a Nightmarish Corporation which by All Accounts sought to benefit from Employee Trauma associated with Containing Horrors. 

It is Important to Keep This In Mind while directing Treatment, especially given the prevalence of formerly useful Defensive Mechanisms no longer being Helpful in their New Environment.

 Integration and Reconnection: Recovery

Broadly speaking, Training spent the least amount of time at the Corporation, and by far the longest time inside this Universe. They are well on their Path of Recovery, being generally at the stage where they have already built up their New Lives. When they were fresh to this Universe they had various Challenges with which I could have helped, but as this was centuries before my time here, I Must Acknowledge That I Was Not Needed. 

Of the group, Ria was the least ready to move on from her Trauma, but with my Help (and the Revelation that she clung to a False Hope) she has made significant progress.  Her desire for a Secret Meaning to the Trauma, something to Make It All Worth It kept her alive and motivated at the Corporation. This was no longer useful in her current context, and she has placed it aside, mourned for it, and made tangible steps towards reconnecting with her desires outside of the context of Trauma.

Mourning and Remembrance: Resting



Contrastingly, Information was still relatively new when I joined this Universe. In general, their challenges remain Rest and Recovery. Progress can not be expected when one is still tired from the Ordeal, after all! While I have, of course, promised my Bestie (Hi, Ronin!)  not to dig too deeply into Vik, while he Monitors me I will record the following information:

Vik has been struggling with self sacrifice, and the mindset that they have no worth unless Serving Others.  Their friendship with Parker has been helpful, in that Parker needs no one and nothing. He is a bundle of wants, but not needs. Vik is learning to do self care.

With Khana, I am under no such restrictions. Even without him being a direct patient of mine, his proud sharing of information has painted quite a clear picture.  In the face of Trauma that could not be bargained with, could not be reasoned with, Khana concluded that the only Power and Safety that could be obtained must be Taken.  That Status is a shortcut to what little Safety there was, as those most likely to be killed or injured were those with the least of it.  In their Home Universe, murder was a quite efficient way to keep oneself safe, while in this Universe it is a quick way to get oneself killed or imprisoned.  Khana is navigating the challenge of learning the New Rules and learning to leverage them. Of learning to Relax now that Being Seen is no longer a Matter of Life And Death.

Yongki has been struggling with far more Physical Trauma than any of the others. The nearest mundane Analogue I can conceive of is Traumatic Brain Injury.  Prior to the Captain joining, Yongki was focused on learning to manage this injury and avoiding making it worse. With the Captain here, Yongki is able to begin taking the first steps of recovery, focusing on learning who he is and what he prefers. 


Meanwhile, Parker's fundamental fear that his Presence Can Only Make Things Worse appears to be eroding with time. Interacting with other refugees from the Corporation appears to be steadily driving home the concept that while he was, in fact, the common thread through all of the Trauma he experienced, he was NOT the cause of it. That the Trauma was fundamentally Out Of His Control and Impersona.  Rather than avoiding the world and abdicating all responsibility for his actions, Parker is learning that even with his Unique Challenges there are ways to Safely Interact.

Stabilization and Safety: Realization 

Captain is the most mysterious of them, in my Eyes. As the newest of my patients to this Universe, he seems actively operating under the assumption that the Traumatic Circumstances he has recently escaped was Correct in some fundamental way. That the Rules he Lived By must have had some Higher Virtue. That he seems willing to Watch and Learn from those who are further along in the Recovery Process bodes well.

Finally, and most intriguing, Camille, in her role as Captain of the Training Team, has informed me that additional refugees have been discovered. Or, perhaps, "refugees" is not quite the right word. There is evidence they are actively still within their Traumatic Environment. This is a Unique Opportunity, both for myself, and for the survivors of their Universe, to participate in Helping Those Ready To Accept It.  And for Acceptance If They Are Not.
