It's a knee-jerk reaction when he recognizes the voice of the first person. She is the first, as she always is-- except in their codenames, he supposes. There's a creak at the door, stumbling into the confessional with a low whisper in her voice, mumbling to herself the whole time. 

The first few minutes are torture for both of them. He sits upright, smoke coalescing in his lungs, and she asks questions he's not supposed to answer. Is she doing this right? is she just supposed to... say whatever? A sin is something bad, so perhaps she should start with that.

The words are a mumble as she traces her mind for something to say. She yelled at someone the other day when she didn't have to. Yesterday, when a friend and her planned to watch a movie, she lied that she was sick so she could stalk her crush. The reason why there are no pens around is because she's been stealing them, and no one's asked yet, but she's sure they've noticed. She's sorry that...

Something in her breaks. Everything else comes out in word-vomit. She is sorry that she drinks, that she smokes, that she lets her whims drag her by the heels to whatever hedonistic urge is on her mind that day. She's sorry for all those she's killed, all of them innocent strangers who didn't deserve to die, all because she can't control herself. She's sorry she ruined the one good thing she had going for her, all because she couldn't just trust them, because she made them carry her weight. She's sorry she's even apologizing-- she begs at him, and he does not answer. She's sorry, she's sorry, she's sorry.

The silence gives them both plenty of time to think about it. She's hardly the deepest sinner, but she is the most consistent. One thing is for sure: as soon as she exits that booth, she will return to normal, as if she never confessed at all.

He tries not to hold it against her. He forgives her, and she leaves without another word.
