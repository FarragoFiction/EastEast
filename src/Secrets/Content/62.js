In the Magnus Archives, which heavily influences my branch of Zampanio...

There's this concept of Choice.

You can be the VICTIM of a fear, no consent needed.

But to become the Avatar of a fear you need to both viscerally fear it AND constantly choose to enable it. 

I'll give you an example. My life has strong Corruption themes. Love ends up betraying me a lot, left abandoned in a literally rotting house, with a body that betrays me just as much. 

Feeling the stress moderating farrago's discord server build up and up and up. 

I had a Choice there. I could have corrupted that server. Turned into a despot. Taken something good and made it harmful. 

Instead I backed the hell off. 

Same thing with some jobs I've had. I've felt it seeping into my bones, the exhaustion, the burn out. I've felt how it could turn me into a toxic worker. 

Instead, I leave. 

If things suck, hit the bricks, etc etc.

So that's an example where my instinctive and immediate response to an opportutnity to choose toxcity and corruption has me on the side of the angels.


But I am not always, and I don't think you are, either, Observer.

So let me tell you about Who Is Shogun.

As originally designed, its job was to be a trap. To SEEM like a normal farrago puzzle but lead no where and have no pay off, and that was the joke.

Eventually it HAD to end, as all things do, so its ending was a request to expand on the structure. To join me in coming up with new riddles for it. 

And then, I don't remember how or why (again, I'm not on farrago's discord server anymore, so the history is lost to me), I had the idea to give it a FAKE ending.

One that gave you a way to access a channel, and gain a role that LOOKED the same as anyone else who had beaten it but... was not.

Locked you into only one of the TWO Who Is Shogun channels. 

And in that channel, everyone who HAD solved that puzzle would gigglesnort to you and slowly lead you to the dawning realization that you HADN'T actually solved it. And then help you get to the real ending.


So. 

Uh.

That dawning realization, in my head, would be one of excitement. It's not over! Goody! More content!

Took a few loops for me to realize that it was DAWNING HORROR in most victims instead.

I literally could not parse there being anything fucked up about putting people in a room full of other people lying to them about how smart they were.

SO!

We changed the channel to EXPLICITLY spell out that actually this was another step in the puzzle, the ending was a false wall, adn now you'd get any tips or help you needed to keep going.

At least one person asked me to tear down the puzzle entirely. That asking people to expand it was evil. 

I refused, but if I recall correctly, that's what lead to the rework of the gaslight ending. 

But that's my point right. Not just that I DID do harm. But that I could not PARSE that harm AS harm.

I'm terrified at betrayal, false friends, being gaslit, being lied to. I'm terrified of being ACCUSED of doing those things.

But somehow all that fear just turned off when it was part of a creative project?

So yeah. There's a reason I present myself as an Avatar of the Spiral.  Not just cause I like the vibes. 

If I were to ever discover I've done capital E evil, I would expect it to be related to that. 

And in the mean time, I try to logic out places I need to be cautious. Warn people that those who seem most harmed by what I create are the ones that obsess.  Give it spooky vibes like a poisonous snake has bright colors. BEWARE, my branch screams. BEWARE. 

I'll still hurt people. You can't live your life without hurting someone. 

But I can try to make sure I take steps to minimize that harm. To warn off those who might be especially susceptible to it. 

But seriously.

Uh. 

If I learned that say, Tumblrs obsession with Columbo was gaslighting. If I learned Columbo just Did Not Exist the way Goncharov doesn't.

Honestly?

I'd be THRILLED.

My interest would immediately multiply by ten and I would dive into finding out everything I could. 

It's why I can't quite parse the #unreality tag surrounding Goncharov as being necessary. 

You can't even say its because I'm naive. I had a really good friend in highschool who had hallucinations and reality problems. 

And yet my instincts still say "fun".

So yeah. 

Observer beware you're in for a scare.
