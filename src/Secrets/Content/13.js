Name: Ronin
Aliases:  None
Coping Strategy: Wounded and Defensive
Attachment Style: Insecure (Avoidant)

Quick Summary:

While Ronin is not a patient of mine (hello hello if you're reading, Bestie :) ), he is one of my oldest friends.

To my shame, I did not correctly See him during our stint at Duskhollow PD, but in the World That Came After, I had the pleasure of working quite closely with him in my role as Minister of Peace.  And, of course, finding him anew in this Universe has been a bright spot that quite outshone all the rest.

I have grown to know him quite thoroughly. A hard worker with high expectations for the world around him who refuses to compromise his integrity, Ronin excels in situations where rules are clearly and strictly enforced across the board.   He has been invaluable in helping me navigate the myriad hidden and esoteric legal statues of this Universe.  I am so, so Proud to see how comfortable he has become in his new Role.  (And while I Know It Is Not My Fault, remain sorry Morgan's Hill was so stifling for him.)

Note: The Whispers Within me call for Ronin. I have taken steps to mitigate any effect this may have on him, to the best of my ability.
