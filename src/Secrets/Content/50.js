Stabilization and Safety: Realization 

Captain is the most mysterious of them, in my Eyes. As the newest of my patients to this Universe, he seems actively operating under the assumption that the Traumatic Circumstances he has recently escaped was Correct in some fundamental way. That the Rules he Lived By must have had some Higher Virtue. That he seems willing to Watch and Learn from those who are further along in the Recovery Process bodes well.

Finally, and most intriguing, Camille, in her role as Captain of the Training Team, has informed me that additional refugees have been discovered. Or, perhaps, "refugees" is not quite the right word. There is evidence they are actively still within their Traumatic Environment. This is a Unique Opportunity, both for myself, and for the survivors of their Universe, to participate in Helping Those Ready To Accept It.  And for Acceptance If They Are Not.
