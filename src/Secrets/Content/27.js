The first person K ever killed? 

Frankly, unlike what seemed to be the assumption those days, he didn't go out of his way to kill. What was the use of that? Those beneath his concern weren't worth killing, those above him he simply had to outsmart, as they often grew lazy in their power...

Those equal to him, though. The teammates? Those were competitors. If he didn't knock them down a peg, they might take the opportunity to do it to him! He couldn't have that. He was smarter than that. So all he had to do was... deny them the opportunity.

He had to have been around fourteen when he claimed his first kill. 

They'd found a perfect place to strike for some quick cash: just outside of syndicate presence, some small mom and pop shop ran by some nobody. A nice and easy target. Not the most dignified steal, but they needed food and money quick-- his more ambitious schemes could wait until after they'd stopped running on red. It wasn't like either of them had homes they were eager to come back to, anyway.

So, it was them, or this shop. And he was happy enough to take from those who didn't watch their own backs.

Him and his buddy snuck in in the dead of night, not even the incessant halogen street lights of the city to give them company, and began to shove shit in their bags as fast as they could. Then, there was the issue of evidence: they knocked out the security cameras, destroyed the records-- there was no way a tiny shop like this could afford to replace them-- and made sure to cover up their tracks by cutting the patterns out of their soles, their shoes deliberately of identical size. It was the perfect hit.

Of course, one thing was committing the crime and the other was getting away with it, and someone had to croak.

He should've seen it coming. If his 'friend' had gotten their way, they would've handed him right into the hands of authorities in order to clear the string of previous allegations stacked against them. 'Just come see me,' they texted him. 'I got good loot to show.'

K knew better than that. Their screams paled compared to his when he beat them to a pulp, tearing chunks off their face with their wired bat.

This world was a dog-eat dog one. And to hell if anyone thought they could cross him like that again.
