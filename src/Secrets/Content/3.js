It's not his place to judge, either. This confessional is in a public space; anyone would wander in, and he is to simply take it, as he has many times before.

He killed them, he says. Shot them down like animals, those underneath him too weak to survive such an arbitrary display of violence. He'd betrayed the rest of his team not once but twice, leaving them to rot because something else caught his attention. So many had come to love him, to be willing to lay down his life for him...

And for what? Just so he could disappear from their lives forever, left only with the problems he'd saddled on them? He knows he'll do it to his best friend eventually, hates that he can even call them that, after all he's done to place some distance. The worst thing that he's ever done is set someone in turmoil up for tragedy, and no matter how many times this repeats itself, he'll always be setting up someone else.
