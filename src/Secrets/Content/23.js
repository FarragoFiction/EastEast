Even when his memory faltered, Captain Yongiki proved to be no stranger to fighting. 

It was an unnecessary observation, truly. While his preference for sweatpants and sweaters and weighted blankets may have deceived some into thinking of him as a soft man, the marks left on his body told a different story: every patch of his skin suffered of inch-deep gashes and bitemarks and burnt flesh, the meat beneath his ribs slashed and torn a thousand times over. A body such as his would look more at home on the leather of a factory animal, unloved and left ragged by years of abuse. 

And yet his physique told a different story-- one of conquered battles and struggle, of power, of dominion. Perhaps Yongiki had not always been so bulky, so naturally predisposed to some sort of innate strength. Instead, it was as if his body had remembered every single injury ever done to him, and vowed to never feel it again. The price of such power was a body left unloved, haunted only by the ache for tenderness.

But that was all useless when it came to answering the question. Sure, perhaps he'd killed many, but the Captain would never regain the why of each lesson carved onto his skin. Such a question would never be answered.

For every legend, however, there were witnesses. Only two people were left in the world to remember his earliest kill, and they both had something different to say.

If you were to ask Vic, they'd tell you it was for the best. The fourth member of their crew, whose name escaped them, had gotten compromised by one of the many beasts that roamed those damned walls. What got her, you may ask? The strangest thing: a pair of red shoes, ever so shiny and polished, which rested upon a pedestal. With it driving her into a murderous frenzy, eyes dripping blood and armed with an axe, it was only fair-- even just-- that she had to die. What was there to do about it? The transformation, once done, was irreversible. Yongiki did them a favor back there by dragging her away from view before she was... liberated, from her duties, one last time.

K, however, had a much different story to tell.

Back when he was 'new', as he called it, following the information team around was one of his favorite pastimes. There were a lot more of them at first-- bunch of minions who needed no names, because that was how irrelevant they were.

But the Captain was cool. Strong, collected, took no bullshit and suffered no idiots. The clowns around him knew their place-- once he spoke, all of them shut their traps and got in line with the program. K could respect that kind of stage presence, and when the time came, the Captain too would bow in admiration of his skill. He was sure of it.

As for that random girl? They'd just found their wrench when the idiot had decided to strap her feet to a monster. He'd barely had time to consider testing his new weapon on her before the Captain swooped down upon her, pinning her to the ground, her sanguine axe flying nearly a foot in the air before he caught it and threw it away from her reach.

The little remorse, the lack of a moment's thought... it was clear she'd been a real thorn on their side. Quiet, but game recognized game; something about her brought out something fierce in the Captain, even before that moment. Maybe they'd been dating. Perhaps they were enemies. Maybe she didn't know her damn place. Who knew? Those details you tend to forget when you see someone cut in front of you.

If there was one thing he swore above anything else, it was that Yongiki was smiling the whole time. He must've enjoyed every second of it.
