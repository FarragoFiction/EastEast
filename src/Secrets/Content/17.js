Name: Khana
Aliases:  K, L-0-I3
Coping Strategy: Violence
Attachment Style: Insecure (Anxious-Avoidant)

Quick Summary:
While Khana is not one of my patients (being highly dismissive of my profession overall), he equally is a frequent visitor to my office. Occasionally he brags that he has access to my more public facing notes, which he acquires between the ending of one loop of the Spiral and the beginning of another.  I am glad to see that someone else in this Universe understands that Knowledge Is Power.

From conversations with others (both patient and non), I am given to understand that he is currently significantly more stable and secure in his position than in some of the earliest Loops, and while I remain Curious as to what could have lead to such positive growth, I am very Aware of how dangerous prying may prove to be.

Khana revels in power over others, both physically and in Knowledge of Secrets. This is expressed in ways that lead him towards gratification through acts such as private security work and other martial endeavors.  It is my speculation that this work, especially through contact with impressionable natives of this Universe, provides him with enough Eyes to secure satisfaction. Evidence towards this hypothesis includes the fact that this work is relatively new to him, and would not be an outlet during his first, more bloody, Loops. 

Overall, he seems to have a standard case of Eye Mania, which up until this point I had thought this Universe was curiously devoid of.
