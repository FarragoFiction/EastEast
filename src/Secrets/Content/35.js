Name: Phil Varker
Aliases:  None
Coping Strategy: Wounded and Defensive (Obsession)
Attachment Style: Unclear

Quick Summary:

Phil was introduced to me through my contacts at the Westerville Police Force. He's on medical leave pending a clear bill of mental health. He has bright, searching eyes and a firm grasp on reality. A forensics specialist, he dreamed of becoming a biologist as a child and finds the idea of alien life extremely plausible. 

This, unfortunately is Necessary Context for understanding the shape of his Maze-Based Obsession.  Phil discovered Impossible Biological Material at the scenes of various crimes (feathers not corresponding to any known bird, human cells impossibly adapted to extremes of temperature, necrotized tissue that nonetheless remains alive, etc etc). 

He became increasingly Obsessed with Getting To The Bottom of the mystery that seemed to be completely Unseen by his Peers, eventually ending with his medical leave.

I'm working with him to separate Relevant Facts from Irrelevant Facts, to develop mindfulness habits intended to steer him away from the grisly fate that remains should he continue along this path.


Note: The Whispers Within me call for him. I continue to develop my own mindfulness techniques to reduce their strength.
