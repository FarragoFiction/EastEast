Broadly speaking, Training spent the least amount of time at the Corporation, and by far the longest time inside this Universe. They are well on their Path of Recovery, being generally at the stage where they have already built up their New Lives.

Her desire for a Secret Meaning to the Trauma, something to Make It All Worth It kept her alive and motivated at the Corporation. This was no longer useful in her current context, and she has placed it aside, mourned for it, and made tangible steps towards reconnecting with her desires outside of the context of Trauma.
