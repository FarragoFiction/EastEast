Parker's first kill was something that he'd seen play out in his mind time and time again.

It was a shift like any other: he was wandering down those metal halls at the beck and call of his boss, his whole team standing behind him. He was a prouder man back then. Not a moment that his back slouched, nor a speck of dirt or dust in him, and no second of the day that he did not meticulously check his appearance, his hair always meticulously tied and brushed into a low tail. The military coat he wore with such pride shone in a pristine marine hue, unbothered by its wear and tear.

The real jewel of its set, though, was the gun. 

Ah, yes. The gun. What was there to say about the gun? That foreign musket shot bullets that could injure ten men with one pull of the trigger, each blow piercing through their chests like a paper plane cruising through air. The satisfaction of wielding such a weapon in his hands, of feeling its intricately decorated brass or the strong walnut core of stock, was unlike any hedonistic pleasure the world could offer. There was never a time he wouldn't take for target practice, and no beast he wouldn't offer to put down with infectious enthusiasm.

But as many things in that forsaken facility, which gave and took so freely, that gun's gift had a price-- or so he would come to learn.

It'd been a while since he'd gotten to shoot something. The benefits of good work meant that the catastrophes he was so eager to address weren't happening, and that meant a lot of free time... and a lot of boredom. 

He didn't know what came over him that day, but if he had to guess, the gun had grown tired of his restraint. Inch by regrettable inch, finger by finger, he trained his aim to wait laid in front of him, the barrel shaking from the force that had overtaken his entire being. The only kindness he was awarded was closing his eyes.

Even after all those years-- long, regrettable years-- his index finger coiled in reflex whenever he thought about it. For as long as he lived, he'd always remember... whether he wanted to, or not.
