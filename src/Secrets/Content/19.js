Quick Summary:

~~~~~~~~~~~

Tyrfing is a relatively new patient of mine. His eyes are deep and piercing, quickly judging as irrelevant most of what he sees.  

As the lone Disciple of a Forgotten God, Tyrfing finds it difficult to find purpose in this new world. His platonic domestic partner has helped him find limited Purpose in the art of domestic combat, such as baking, PTA meetings and minor local politics, and he is fiercely protective of his (non clone) children, however briefly they exist.

Together we are working on small ways for him to feel like his purpose is being met, such as  spreading  the Word of Nidhogg, describing the Secret Truth of the Betrayal of the 4 Divines, and similar.  While we do not share religious beliefs I am always happy to help Spread Knowledge. (And, on a Personal Note, I do understand what it is like to have Societally Unacceptable Religious Beliefs in this Universe. I miss my Home.)
