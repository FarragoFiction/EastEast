She's sat at her desk, pen idly scratching doodles onto a notepad. They're overwhelmingly cheerful. Clouds. Smiles. Eyes. 

She meets one of the orbs' gaze with equanimity, face blank.

There is a piece of her, deep within, that misses Home with the ache of a long healed injury. 

It helps, some days, to talk about how it all had been with those few refugees she's managed to find. 

Other days she finds solace in one of the few ways this world provides to both See and Be Seen. Social media is, of course, a disappointingly tasteless way to scratch that itch, but... It is what it is.

A perfectly manicured nail (bubblegum pink, of course) taps out a staccato beat into the wood of her desk. Not morse code, never that. She wrinkles her gently upturned nose at the thought of trying to conceal information. No. Just a simple rhythm. A melody from better times.

The phone at her desk buzzes to life and she silences it with a sigh of relief.  There. The designated Two Minutes of Ennui were complete!   Her features come to life, all smiles that go all the way to her eyes and energy and happiness, as if the sadness itself had been a mask she had had to don.

It's important! She reminds herself, getting up from her desk, to not accidentally conceal any Sad Emotions that might be lurking underneath the surface! You have to face everything head on! With Clear Eyes!

TODAY is a very important day! She will be Professional and she will be Compassionate and she will keep Hard Boundaries and she will finally, FINALLY get to speak directly with Wanda. If there could be said to be a single person in this universe who knows even a fraction of what Jaimie, He Who Knows, knows, then it would have to be her.

And Doctor Fiona Slaughter, licensed psychotherapist, wants to know everything she can.

When her office had been broken into and her private notes obviously copied she had nearly cried in relief.  Finally! Finally something makes sense! Someone cared that there was knowledge!  Someone AGREED it didn't belong under lock and key and ciphers and secrecy!  Knowledge Wants To Be Free!

She was, of course, perfectly aware that this Universe believed certain types of information to be less free than others and... if she was to fit in, concessions must be made. But the thrill and delight that coursed through her as she followed thread after thread all the way to its source, the "CEBro" of Eyedol games herself? Exquisite.

And today she would have her closure. Her catharsis. She would stand before the most Holy figure this corrupted Universe had to offer.

She adjusts her bouncy blond hair in one of the many mirrors, grabs her bag (immaculately coordinating with her white and pink outfit, of course), and steps out to face the day.
