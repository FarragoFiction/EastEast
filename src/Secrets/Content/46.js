A gasp escapes her as the gag around her mouth is torn off. It's still pitch black- the leathery fabric around her eyes won't let her see any further than her nose. 

She wails. A glove forces her mouth shut. She whines in pain as she bites her tongue. 

Some other voice, a male one, mutters an oh my god. Is it someone else? She kicks her legs, fighting out of the grip, albeit furtively. There is nothing she can do to break out of the ropes she's been tied with. 

"Oh my god," echoes the voice. "Please just-- um-- put her down?"

There's a shift in her hold. Then gravity sets in: she hits the ground with a thud face-first. Fuck! She bounces back from the pain, flipping over. Her nose feels wet with blood. 

"Woah! O-okay!"Another set of hands run over her body, a finger wiping what she thinks is blood off her top lip. "I'll-- I'll take care of it, alright?"

The other presence stills, and then she hears their footsteps, not for the last time, as they exit the room. 

What are they going to do to her?

Apparently, keep her as a trophy.

By now, they've cut off her restraints. The cabin she's been locked into is not a pretty sight. The wood is rotten, presumably from abandonment. There are lights, but none of them work; most have burst by now. The weird man tasked with taking care of her tries to keep everything else in a salvageable condition. All the windows are covered in planks.

She's still not sure what they want with her. But he flashes a smile, one that is maybe a little apologetic, every time he comes to bring her eggs. 

Scrambled eggs. Sunny-side eggs. Poached eggs and boiled eggs. Over-easy. Baked. Day in and day out, all he ever seems to cook are eggs. When she dares to ask why, he only ever musters something about how she seemed to like them, and she's never liked anything else. She tries listing anything else: bread, beans, fruit, veggies, meat. His eyebrows furrow and it's an emotion that she's come to know well; it's guilt.
