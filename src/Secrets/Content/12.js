Name: Witherby 
Aliases:  The Solemn, L-0-R1
Coping Strategy: Unknown
Attachment Style: Unknown

Quick Summary:

It has been impressed upon me by my primary employer that should I interact with Witherby, I will "lose my Visa" to this layer of Reality. 

While I do miss my homeland, I am under no Illusion that I will be neatly returned there should I violate this contract.

Still..one can't help but notice certain commonalities in accounts of him, and I will collate these fragments of impressions here.

is the only one of the training team who files taxes
is standoffish and cold
goes to an incredible amount of trouble to help those within his inner circle
has a strong moral compass
has an equally strong streak of petty thievery
observant
easy to talk to
provides therapy like services to everyone outside the training team
refuses to provide therapy like services in his 'off hours'
