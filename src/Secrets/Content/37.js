To this day I still don't know if "Zampanio" exists. Maybe the rabbit hole that first fAQ lead me into was just an arg a particularly obessive sburbsim fan lead me into?

and i barely even care! 

i love the vibes!

i love how open it feels?

(and if it WAS an arg, holy fuck, what a cool concept. an arg designed to target a niche fandom? or even just a single person?)

so thats the direction i'm trying to take the zampanio fandom. 

what fandoms can we sink our tendrils into

will a lobotomy corp fan one day make the exact right google search and fall into this rabbit hole?

what about magnus archives?

and the Herald is trying to get rain world in!

each of us has a wholly unique world inside of us. a different subset of reality we interact with.

each of us can make a personalized branch designed to catch...well...US of all people.

and the fun is seeing who else gets caught by the same bait that would catch you.
