Name: Parker
Aliases:  The Shot, L-0-21
Coping Strategy: Chaotic (See Summary)
Attachment Style: Chaotic (See Summary)

Quick Summary:

Parker is a positive JOY to work with. His eyes are an open book to his inner workings, What You See is absolutely What You Get.

According to him his impulse control was "stolen by some anime girl" one, or possibly two Universes ago.  Regardless of why, this results in quite a fascinating case. Quite ironically, given his proclivity towards deep tunnels into the earth, his problems are entirely kept on the surface, with no knowledge needed of his history.

Our focus has been on giving him more tools to make sure his first impulse in a situation is one he won't later regret. He has taken well to flashcards, post it notes and various other reminders of the options he has in any stressful situation.   While this HAS contributed to the overall... shall we say complex nature of his living environment, it has clearly lead to him feeling more in control and capable in his day to day life.

Examples of flashcards that have worked especially well include "BAN THEM", "CALL THEM ON THE PHONE", "ASK VIK IF THIS IS OKAY" and "SEND THEM A MESSAGE".  It is surprising how many disparate situations these cards can apply to.

NOTE: We are working on getting him to kidnap me less often.
