Name: Yongiki(updated)
Aliases:  The Reflection, L-0-I1-alpha
Coping Strategy: Avoidance
Attachment Style: Secure

Quick Summary:

I am happy to report that the Heresy has been resolved and Yongiki has stabilized. While Mirrors are still not his favorite objects in the world, with the actual ability to retain Memory Yongiki is able to Grow as a person.

He proves himself to be an admirably Curious young man, with a desire to Learn Everything he can.  However, he has little tolerance for challenge or strife, preferring to learn the lesson that, for example, "Hammocks are evil" rather than trying to overcome them.

His relationship with his Peers has proven somewhat more difficult. While he is friendly and upbeat, those around him have long grown into the habit of avoiding getting too attached to someone who may Vanish with little to no notice.  Yongiki seems to believe this is simply the state of the world, and his overwhelming power results in him having little need to rely on others. As a result, he seems perfectly secure and content with his relatively solitary nature.

This is not to say that there are no social challenges. In particular, I am working with him to better navigate his ..."roommate", while also helping him take initiative in instructing his Peers on the damage they can do to him while feuding with the Captain.
