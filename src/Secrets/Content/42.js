Something that struck me as weird just now?

The different reflections of me that are out there. The different shambling horrors. 

The Cultist knows a different me than the Herald than the original Marked. 

But especially the Cultist.

The Cultist, you see, specializes entirely in a me that is as close to AB as you can get, in that it is a robot version of me frozen in their teens.

And it's weird seeing that corpse dragged back into the light of day?

'Glomp' and 'the matrix' and 'TAB' and all of that. 

An ill fitting mask?

And yet... unquestionably me. Past and Present spiralling together.

Even this is past, from your point of view. 

Shards of myself left in places both hidden and obvious. A jigsaw puzzle you can assemble to make a picture with no right answer.

Who is JR, I guess is what I'm asking here. jaded? justified?

Speaking of past and present spiralling together, no sooner than I had taken Recursion as my name and scorned the Researcher than I got an opportunity to become a Researcher once again, as a side job.  I'm still jaded, there's no doubt about that but... there's reasons to double up on jobs right now for me.  Here's hoping it doesn't eat up too much of my time. 

And that I don't get caught up in the Illusion that I can return to a Past That Never Was.  I stopped being a researcher, I became jaded, for a reason, you know? Nostalgia isn't a reason to repeat mistakes.
