Coming back to that old cabin was weird as hell.

He thought he was done with it. Why wouldn't he be? The bad guy got caught, after all. Tried on national television. Yeah, the world's only reigning quadrillionaire appeared out of nowhere and greased the hands of the judicial system to get her out, which is a problem in and of itself, but in the grand scheme of things, it was a solid eight out of ten.

So why the fuck was he back here?

Well, there were a couple of reasons. His mind had taken time to enumerate them in a numbered list.

After hearing the trial, allowing the Eye Killer to seclude herself again along with her hostages was a bad idea.

His hand went to knock on the door, beginning with a rhythmic pattern: knock, knock, knock knock--

Fuck.

He hiccuped on the last beat, punching a clean hole through the door. He stared at his arm, a good meter into the house now. Sigh. So much for a normal approach, he guessed.

It didn't take long for his entrance to be noticed; a repeated _clink_ could be heard from right behind him. He turned around, and sure enough, there she was: the Eye Killer, fresh out of court, trying to stab into him with a small razor.

It was not working. 

Ronin looked down at her. A smirk escaped him. “What, already antsy out of prison?”

Her eye shone dangerously in response, along with some sort of guttural snarl. Her motions went to scratching at the absence of any progress in stabbing, the razor tearing through his clothes and thin layer of faux-muscle, and leaving dents in the metal layer underneath.

“Mhm.” She raised her arm again-- he found purchase on her forearm, stopping the blow mid-swing. Her strength was formidable for a woman her size, but it simply wasn't enough to overpower the mechanical prowess of his late father. His arm shook under the pressure. “Listen, I wasn't trying to tear up your door,” he said, both sets of eyes looking back at it. A glimpse of the bedroom was not too far in. “Barely knew you lived here, to begin with. I'll patch up the door, alright? Just give me a hammer and something to work with.”

The killer twitched under his grip, the thick trench coat unable to slip away from the hold. They look at each other. 

His arm went limp.
