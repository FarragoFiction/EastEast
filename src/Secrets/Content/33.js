Similar variations of this saying have been in use since ancient times.  The modern wording that we are familiar with today, first appeared in the J. T. Bickford novel, ‘Scandal’ in 1857. The proverb has been in this present form in the USA since the 1820s.

The phrase means that no matter who you are with or where you are in the world, your family and home always have the deepest affection and emotional pull. It is the place where you have a foundation of love, warmth, and happy memories. It might not always be the building itself, but being near your loved ones.

Home is where the heart was, where is it now?

Where could it ever be. 

How could it have been your home, if you so callously abandoned it. One more thing upon the Pyre of your former life. One more thing sacrificed to the unrelenting desire to KNOW.

And what has knowing bought you? What satisfaction has it wrought? 

Is anyone saved, anyone at all, through your obsession?

When you finally reach the spiraling the center, the end which is not, COULD not, ever be an end, will you finally be happy?
