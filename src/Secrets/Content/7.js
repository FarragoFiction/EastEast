Excerpt: From the Private Notes of Dr. Fiona Slaughter

If you're reading this, you have my congratulations. I had feared these words would remain trapped and stifled for all time, dusty and inert on these pages, fed only by my Eyes alone.

But I Hoped, and my words marching along your synapses is proof it was worth it.

Thank you for navigating the safes and ciphers required by my various contracts and legal obligations.  Thank you for reading these.  

As a courtesy, I have attempted to organize my records as best as I can to make sense to an outsider*.  In exchange, please do your best to keep this information to yourself, or at least do no harm to my patients. 

Thank you,

Dr. Fiona Slaughter

* JR NOTE: PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT DOC SLAUGHTER IS FROM ANOTHER (MORE PARANOID) UNIVERSE, AND THAT THOSE WRITING HER ARE NOT ACTUALLY LICENSED PSYCHOTHERAPISTS. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER OPINIONS AS FACTS.
