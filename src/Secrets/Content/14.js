Quick Summary:



Look, Fiona. It's Ronin writing this-- though you'd guess that anyway eventually. You asked me to make sure you couldn't go all weird and obsessive about this fella again, so I went ahead and erased all your notes about them.

Listen, I don't want to be the asshole, but you PROMISED me you wouldn't go looking again, so like. This is it. This is me telling you why you aren't supposed to. You didn't like who you became and it only ends up with you getting your mind wiped AGAIN.

Yes, I know that's not supposed to be possible for you.

Yes. It still happened.

NO.  Trying to find out why does NOT lead to you learning a way around it.

Believe me. Okay? Trust me when I say you made it VERY clear that this wasn't good for you, your weird religion be damned.

So close this file and think about one of your other patients, okay?
