There's a tumblr post I saw today, that baited me into non-zampanio posting, but there is more I'd like to say, but in a place where there are less Eyes.

Part of the post was: "People are always shocked when I tell them yes, I'm in pain right now. I'm always in pain. I sometimes take painkillers, but it's not feasible to take them all the time and if I did they'd stop working. I just live like this, and some days are worse or better than others, but I am always, ALWAYS in pain. And there isn't really anything else the doctors can do about that."

And yeah.

This.

I remember my own shock when I realized that there were so very many things that doctors couldn't even diagnose except by excluding other things.

So many things where even if you get a diagnosis there isn't a shot or a pill or a surgery you can have that fixes things.

And I remember having to deal with that initial shock while ALSO navigating the shock of the people around me?

I went into work, back when I was a Researcher, on all but the very worst days.

I remember HR coming to me. 

I remember not actually being able to sit up, so I had a little cot under my desk and was doing my job on a laptop.

HR told me I could take disability leave, that I should focus on "getting better".

And I had a conversation with her, that did help me feel better (because it always makes me feel better to put my thoughts out in the world instead of leaving them rattling in my head).

I told her that I didn't think I WOULD get better. That there were no more tests scheduled.

That I was a few months away from my appointment with a specialist.

And she seemed so lost at that, and I felt so lost at that.

Because in the TV, if your body suddenly stops working they put you in the hospital and they don't let you leave till they F1X TH1S.

But when I stopped being able to move at random intervals and I went to the ER they just did a blood test and told me I'd need to see a Neurologist and they didn't have one on staff. 

So they just...let me go.

And my regular Neurologist could do a few tests, enough to go "yup, your body is fucked" but not enough to say WHY. And even that came after months of other tests that showed nothing.

There was no group of highly motivated specialists just THERE at the hospital ready to help me.

Deadend after deadend.

The only specialist I could find on any of the things it might be was able to confirm I DIDN'T have his thing?

And that's when I decided to stop.  The tests were painful. Getting to appointments that were further and further away was painful and hard. My main neurologist just went and quit his practice and I didn't have the energy to find a new one.  The energy to find new specialists to try, either.

They call it a 'diagnosis of exclusion'. 

When you have ruled out everything that plays nicer with tests and you're left with something harder to test for.

It FEELS less legitimate? To have no 'proof'.  Especially when I saw more than a few shit doctors who were all too happy to tell me it was "all in my head" without even looking at my tests.

But, and this in no way constitutes medical advice, yada yada yada...

BUT.

I went from being in a wheel chair most days to having no symptoms at all most days.

Because the diagnosis that everyone avoided because its so damn hard to prove if you don't have the five most common genes for it (when theres  over 30 identified)...

Was something called Periodic Paralysis. 

And turns OUT. 

It can be managed. 

Not cured.

Not even controlled.

But. 

That's not nothing. 

Even if there is no doctor within a thousand miles that apparently could diagnosis it.

Even if I don't KNOW I have that thing.

I can follow the tips and tricks to manage it and for the first time, something *worked*.

Fuck potasium, I guess. Turns out its my kryptonite.

With this new lens I could look back at when it all started and see that every single stress response I had to suddenly being disabled was flat out on the list of "don't do this if you have Periodic Paralysis".

I could even see that a lot of my childhood physical "quirks" were a milder form of it. That it got worse in my early twenties but we thought I was "fainting" (p sure past me posting about this might be part of what made people think i died as eon337), even if I wasn't losing consciousness.

And after spending so much time researching on my own, I learned it tends to go from "full body paralysis but only for a second or two" to partial paralysis but for longer as you age. i.e. from 'fainting' to "stuck in a wheelchair all day because i can kinda move but not enough to stand up"

Suddenly my life made SENSE? I felt in control?

Point is.

There's plenty of things doctors can't cure or fix.  (But srsly, still a good idea to rule out what CAN be ruled out with doctors. I don't think I would have even HEARD of Periodic Paralysis without them, and believe you me, there were dozens of possibilities that the tests and doctors ruled out that I wouldn't have been able to.)
