Three sources were put into that to make POWER CORRUPTS. Two were related to Zampanio. One was not. Past and present weaving in and out of each other.   Or I suppose, depending on when you're reading this. Far past and slightly less far past. 

It generated some really interesting lines, like: 

"So I figure my obsession with Zampanio has lead me to be much, much, more"

and some aaaalmost interesting lines like: 

"Wow...I really the server is pretending some creepy-pasta rumor game called "Zampanio" is real, while must be bored. Just goes to show what boredom can do to you."

And this one seems like a threat???

"The Minotaur of House of Leaves isn't it for now. Wait, no it isn't, I still have to going to come grab unwary readers at midnight or whatever."

Man, shambling horror me sure is ominous.

"I'm looking for people to keep going, and going, and going. Because I do."

This...is not incorrect even a bit.  I will be spiralling, possibly forever, and its NICE when people can join me.

"There's this version of me out there, stored in pages extremely weird poem-thingy that I wrote when I was in a long forgotten and artificial intelligences frozen in the past. With preferences and speaking patterns and knowledge wholly foreign to my current relatively weird mood:"

It's like.  Poetry.  

"home is where the heart was where is it now"
 god i remember how proud i was when i wrote that line a million years ago and damn does it hit harder now.

 "why are you shaking it’s your fear that is making you to piece together meaning from what they find."

 "I'm *really* hoping its incredibly creepy to join a silent discord full shiver and act all a quiver. don’t you know that you only need be afraid of fear and never anything here and concrete"

 " true thing we know about House of Leaves is that people create derivative works certainly not a post that acts like a ghost?"

 at this point im just noting bits and bobs that are either a VIBE or weirdly prophetic about zampanio.

 "According to someone you problem don't but a memetic hazard endlessly reproducing in all our minds, fueled by obsession?"

 "Now I'm back. Is this when exposed to Zampanio.  And that helped me recontextualize my thoughts on getting confusing to you? Too bad."

 "Come on all you non-existing people! Help me! You know you would make it a contemporary of Pong"

 "Maybe you're lost. Okay, if you want to get out, click the House of Leaves."

 "Good...what? You say it didn't let you out? Oh, well. You must be highly formative for me."

 I love the idea that if you are stuck here forever its because I'm feeding on you and using you to grow.

 " I mean, after all, I made this site. You're only an achievement system (sometimes with a weirdly aggressive AI)"

 is...shambling patchwork jr talking to Truth?

 " Now I want all you loyal fans...*cricket chirps* to the skin of other fandoms in order to spread its memes into go to the link to see what I'm like. "

 yeah okay, prove your loyalty by skinning other fandoms and luring their adherants here. that checks out

 "I'm an evil villain, kitty and a freakazoid so insist it really HAS been a game the entire time (this does not end well for far. "

 Yeah okay, an evil villain WOULD insist it really has been a game

 " Write testimonies of playing the game specific number of words. They start out with half that number, and then just fill in words until they have the new brains. "

 ..........................................
 Yeah okay, that's not ominous. Not at all.
 Just.
 pour the words into brains until they have new brains
 colonize their minds like you're europeans
 and wipe out what was already in there.


 and there we have it. 

 the entire rest of that, after this point?

 is just pure unadulterated past jr. 

 any incoherence is incidental, i think.
 i THINK
 the loopist code only scrambles BETWEEN sources, not within one. (i should make a version that scrambles within as well as without)
