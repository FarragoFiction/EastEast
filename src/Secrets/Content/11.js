* JR NOTE: PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT DOC SLAUGHTER IS FROM ANOTHER (MORE PARANOID) UNIVERSE, AND THAT THOSE WRITING HER ARE NOT ACTUALLY LICENSED PSYCHOTHERAPISTS. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER OPINIONS AS FACTS. 

Name: Devona
Aliases:  The Twins, L-0-R4
Coping Strategy: Avoidance
Attachment Style: Secure

Quick Summary:

When Devona enters a room her eyes scan every corner of it, taking it all in. You can tell just how kind and considerate she is by her attention to every detail, no matter how irrelevant. 

That kindness leads her to hide her pain and her worries, even from those she trusts. She fears being a burden almost as much as she fears being misunderstood. 

Her strong friendship with Neville, is a source of strength for her, as he sees through even her most clever of facades. However she worries about over relying on him, hence her desire for my services.

It is fortunate that anxiety caused by Knowledge is something of a speciality of me from my time in Morgan's Hill.  

Together we focus on practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 method for coping with anxiety, where she identifies 5 things to see, 4 things to touch, 3 things to hear, 2 things to smell and 1 thing to taste.   In doing this, we are trying to help her form the habit to use her impressive observation talent to break panic spirals, rather than fall into the trap of being Blind to the Outer World while lost in Unhelpful Thoughts.
