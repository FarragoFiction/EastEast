To Vik, the question of 'their first kill' rang deaf to their ears. After ████████████████████████████ from ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████, they'd long lost the concept of a mundane death-- one where the body simply decomposed and laid forgotten. But even though the deaths of the corporation had become a shapeless memory, their first 'kill' in that hellish universe was still brand new. 

At first, they didn't know they were hungry. Their existing condition made it too easy to confuse bodily pains with each other, and they still had meals as normal, so judging such aches as relevant was not an idea they were used to. So for a while they continued as if nothing was wrong, corralling Yongiki along and making sure K had something to do. Whatever that stomach bug was, they thought, it'd surely leave of its own accord.

But as with any infection left untreated, in face of no antidote, it only grew in scope.

It started with their voice. For every██████████████, only two came out, the rest replaced with ████████████████████████████. Then, it dulled their senses: colors became flatter, smells became fainter. When they slipped with a knife and carved it right through their ███████some sort of███████ from their ███████,, they found no pain to comfort them-- only the excess dripping of saliva from their mouths, and the creeping realization of what they were truly hungry for.

Even then, knowing all of that, they could not bring themselves to hunt. Who were they to deny life, especially when they did not wish to live ardently in the first place? 

No. If someone was going to do such atrocities, it would not be them. 

And so it went, for the longest time: their body ███████ front of ███████ else's, growing only more and more██████████████to feed████████████████████████████ stomach████████████████████████████ guts██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ to feast██████████████more and more and more and more and MORE.  

Their subordinates should've ran when they could. By then, when K came to check on them, shouting their name and hitting at the walls with his wrench, only a thought remained in their head, less an idea and more an order.
