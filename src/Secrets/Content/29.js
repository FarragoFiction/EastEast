When I was little, like, maybe middle-elementary school little? 10 or so? 

My very favorite thing to do on the playground was to Organize Events. 

I'd cordon off a slide, for example, and not let kids up unless they knew the "password". The password, ofc, being anything at all.  

I only ever rejected people if they refused to even try.

My little brother would be my minion, and something about that drew people in as well. They wanted to help. 

Sometimes we'd have whole story lines, sometimes we'd go to war with each other, or put on a circus. Someitimes it'd just be the pw game but we'd be able to block off more exits.

I just enjoyed creating a context for so many strangers to play together in all their own ways. 

I remember one time I pulled the password trick, and some kid REFUSED to guess. Everyone would EVENTUALLY, especially with all the hints I would give to it being super easy.

But this kid, no, he went and got his mom who yelled at me and it sucked. 

I wasn't trying to ACTUALLY block access to the slide. I was trying to make it feel more magical when you used it. Like you were part of a conspiracy. And I wanted to learn a little bit about the participants. What sorts of things they'd guess. Its the first steps to being friends.

I think about that kid a lot, when I remember making [???].  That all I want is for people to try. To engage with me.

I want the world to feel mysterious and special and connected. I want YOU to feel special and connected. And mysterious too, if you want. I sure enjoy that vibe but I know its not for everyone.

The internet is huge and the barrier to entry to "matter" feels impossible, like you gotta be some kind of Influencer with millions of followers. 

But sometimes, in order to matter, all you need to do is be on a playground and have fun with strangers.

I hope you're having fun :)
