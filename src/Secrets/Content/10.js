Quick Summary:

Neville is a Fascinating Enigma. When he first entered my office, I could, quite plainly, see nothing behind his eyes. He seemed easy enough, affable and friendly, and perfectly willing to engage with my work.  And yet nothing seemed to stick. 

To my Frustration, any attempts to get him to open up, or to See Beyond the Surface bore absolutely no fruit.   He claimed he was "fine" and saw no actual reason for any dissatisfaction with his lot in life.  To my shame, my assumption had been that he simply was not aware of the facts of his new Reality.

And yet.

On our fourth session, Neville quite surprised me by mentioning that it makes sense I'm not familiar with Minoburgers as I am "not from around here, either". When I asked what he meant, he casually pointed to a dozen or so tiny mannerisms I had that were indicators of being Foreign to this Universe. Mannerisms I was completely unaware I did not share with the wider populace. 

Still Waters do indeed Run Deep with this one.

Overall, his assessment that he is doing well seems an accurate one, to my bewilderment.  He has a support network both within his found family and without it, as well as more casual friends across the world. He acknowledges quite openly the bad in his life, and remains optimistic that they can be overcome.

I've made it clear to him I may have nothing to provide for him, but he insists on continuing his visitations since "you never know" when things might change. 

Truly a mystery.
