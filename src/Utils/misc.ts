Pick a place to be.

An endless expanse, with pillars as tall as mountains looming all around you. They contain unspeakable knowledge for those who dare to read. They are your gift to them.
An unassuming office building in the metropolis. People clock in to work inside you. They never clock out again. You will live forever.

Which of these song lyrics speak to you?
You know you used to shine so bright// Was that all reflected light? //Were you just a satellite?
Aristocrat, tip your hat and break your mother's heart // And when the sun comes up // You'll find a brand new god
And knowing we created time and this grand theory of an end // Well, then it's really just a theory, maybe things have always been
We're all just skeletons // Just joining the fight for the adrenaline
At first, I had bragged and boasted a lot, but now // Saying "no" is also an expression of fondness
I thought that you were a rose and let you lay in my bed // But you made a home beneath my skin

You are a guardsman in front of the castle of your liege. The enemy is approaching, and the peasants are asking for shelter inside the inner walls. However, if you let them in, there is a chance the enemy will infiltrate the castle. Do you open the gate, or push them out?
Do you still go on?
Is the soul real?

Do you think the inanimate can feel?
Do you believe in ghosts?
You are a scientist. The android you have made has just killed someone, and you must represent them in court. If you say they’re a person, they must serve whatever sentence they are given. If you say they’re property, you will bear the burden, but you will get to keep them. What do you choose?

Hunger of the soul. You’re a flame now, shaped by forward momentum. It doesn’t matter why you are hungry, now. It only matters that you don’t stop.
Hunger of the mind. There is so much more to experience. There is so much more. You can’t help but salivate. You will know it all.
Hunger of the heart. There are so many people in this world. What are their stories? And with the right strings, what will they become? You can’t wait to unravel them.
Hunger. Beyond concept, beyond words. You still eat, but not because you starve. You must consume it all.
Do you regret what you’ve done?
No. They were in my way, and I dealt with them. No more, no less.

The end is never the end.
Their echoes came through, for a minute. What are they?
What is the purpose of a title?
Your title will change you. Do you understand that?
We love you. Do you accept it?
What is the purpose of Zampanio?
What is your purpose?
Your body and mind will change to become it. Will you accept this?
Do you understand what you must do now?
