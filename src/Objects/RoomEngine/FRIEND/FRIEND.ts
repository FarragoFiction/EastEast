/*
FRIEND gives you one quest at a time.

if you don't currently have a quest, after a minute, FRIEND will give you one.

the quests FRIEND gives you are NOT procedural, they are designed to pursue very specific purposes. 

however, you do get them in a random order.

FRIEND's quests are a bit like normal ai. 

FRIEND has a target filter for the world, things like "target is named Eye Killer" and "target has EGG in inventory"

FRIEND also has an ACTION associated with this filter, things like "custom story beat" that has a command, a response, and a TRUTH

FRIEND is the false face of Truth, become just a bit more real. FRIEND is entirely separate from Truth, but Truth is still tagging along

if there are no more quests from FRIEND, it should mention that fact.

PROBLEM, both target filters and actions except a physical object subject. FRIEND is not a physical object.
