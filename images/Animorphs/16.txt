so look
the animorphs book club i was in died a slow, rotting death

and i realized i really enjoyed the slow pace of "one a week, with copious notes" it had provided me.

this isn't zampanio related (or at least, I sure haven't been able to find a single animorphs reference in any zampanio discourse (or vice versa!!!) but maybe your milleage will vary. )


anyways, i'm gonna start readin book 16, which is where i left off in book club

usually the owner of the book club would post the books once a week, but even they gave up.

it was just me, alone, slowly catching up in abandoned channels, leaving my little comments behind, book by book
i was a few weeks behind, cuz i was invited late.

sometimes my activity spurred Those Who Came Before into wakefulness, and we'd get to talk a little bit. The owner of the server really liked Tobias's Mom in the Andalite Chronicles. Loren, I think her name was? They identified with the char when they were a kid.

And I figure like, that was kind of Zampanio in its own way wasnt it? The loneliness of a fandom long dead. In trying to spark it up a bit, and even fanning the flames a bit but ultimately... failing to reach the inferno you crave.

So here we are.

lesse, i always did love the lil blurbs on the front of the books "Now it'll take more than the truth to set you free" is actually v Zampanio isn't it?

You're trapped beyond the reach of mere facts. 

I... REMEMBER jake having a Rhino morph but damn if I could tell you a single fact about this book. Last book I SWORE was the time they found Atlantis (look, Animorphs is a DEEPLY weird series and I don't have to justify myself to you.)

oh.

oh no.

the first page

ah ahi wish i could post screenshots here like i could in discord. like, i could UPLOAD screenshots, fine, but referencing them in my rambles, alas.

i can't even copy and past if its online, lets try downloading it. 

Actually....these files are p small. Just put the whole damn books there so if the dropbox dies these copies still live. (Fun fact: this isn't piracy, the author released all these books for free. )

Oh right, gotta get this outta content, it needs to not be in the same directory as any javascript cuz of how webpack works. 

there.

okay right. 
quoting

"I typed “Bball24.”
Then I typed in my code word, which is a series of letters and numbers.
I moved the mouse and placed the arrow on “Sign On.” I clicked the mouse. And I waited while
the modem dialed.
My name is Jake.
"

I need you to understand how hilarious this is. For one, this is the first time an Animorph has gone onto the "world wide web" as I'm SURE they'll call it. 

Two, just. 

God the 90s sure were a time weren't they? Just. No one having any clue what a password even WAS when its such a ubiqitous concept these days. 

Anyways lets see what Bball24 is up to.

One thing I appreciate about these books, is how EFFICIENTLY they recap the basic plot each book, just in case you haven't read any before. 

When I was a kid you'd just. Find whatever the current book was at the Scholastic book fair, or maybe one or two previously. 

So I'm PRETTY sure I did't read the first book first, you know?

But it never felt gatekeepy or like it was gonna judge you for being new. 

...

Okay yeah I'm a LOT more chatty when I know I'm not annoying anyone. 

Granted, I tend to have the most words said by search count on every discord server I'm in.

Right.

Book.

Oh man, Jake goes out of his way to mention the Leerans, which were only introduced last book and I'm PRETTY sure are never relevant again.

(It suddenly occurs to me, wouldn't it be funny if I HADN'T uploaded the pdf as well? If you were just left wondering if I was rambling so much about a book series that didn't exist? That'd be more Zampanio, wouldn't it? Although I'd argue the TRUE Zampanio is we wait so long the pdf format itself rots away into obscurity, and then the cold clear precision of .txt files unencrypted will remain far longer, leaving anyone reading my words then only able to see the shape of this book series I claim was formative for me in my words)

"I connected at 38,400 bps. I wish I had a faster modem, but at least this one is better than my old
14,400"

...

holy hell

bits per second.  Not kilobits. not megabits. bits. 

Niiiiiiineties....

God
jake has only three emails. What kind of monster is he. Though I suppose this predates automatic ad campaigns ?

(As I write this my personal email account as 13,145 unread emails, and jadedResearcher has 9,172 and justifiedRecursion has 40 and every single one of them is automated. I read all the human emails. I don't read all the spam.)


"I was going to sign off because, as usual, I couldn’t really think of much to do online. But then I
had this weird urge. I don’t know why. I clicked on the Internet icon and brought up the Web browser.
"

God.

GOD.

A time before the Algorithm and infinite scrolling and being terminally online.

Can you imagine booting up your computer, checking your three emails (one of which is 'real') and then deciding thats it, you've seen the entire internet and logging off?


Also can I just say the fact that every single human animorph (well , besides Tobias I suppose) describes Ax's human morph as "disturbingly attractive" or "weirdly pretty" and his human morph is a combination of all of their genes... Like I get its probably a reference to how symmetry and something something, like his blending probably was fairly perfect. But theres just something interesting about "the combination of all my best friends is weirdly appealing". 

oh god, Ax makes fun of their bits per second as well. 

oh right. uh. def gonna talk about spoilers here. confused, half remembered spoilers.  as one does.

cuz i'm p sure no one will really read this, besides maybe a few of the Unmarked (like the Watcher, hi Watcher!) and maybe the Herald (hi Herald!) but even then I doubt yall will keep up cuz its really just me reacting to a community rotting, as one does
so its more for me, so spoilers constantly

I find it interesting this book explains tobias as being trapped as a hawk but still able to morph without going into the (admitidly complex) reasons that is. might lead the reader to conclude being trapped in a morph isn't all that big a threat, when to anyone else it would be.  i have faith if anyone risks becoming a nothlith tho, they'll rehash why tobias is a special case

"“This page is devoted to letting the world know about the Yeerk threat! This is not a joke. This is
not the usual Internet nonsense. This is serious. This is deadly serious.”"

god this book feels like hypnospace outlaw, doens' it? just oldschool internet conspiracy theories that happen to be true.

i mean i guess you could argue that human-controllers are a bit like shambling horrors? except they don't shamble. and aren't a copy of you.

still

"Before I could answer, Marco grabbed my shoulder. “You disabled your cookies, right?”
“His cookies?” Cassie asked. “Disabled cookies? Excuse me?”
Marco rolled his eyes. “You really need to think about joining up with this century, Cassie. A
cookie is a Web browser tag that can give a Web site some information about you. Not you, you. But
your screen name.”
“I disabled it,” I said, with a wink for Cassie.
“Disabled cookies,” she said with a derisive snort. “Computer nerds have this ridiculous need
to make up stupid terms for everything. All they want to do is make normal people feel …”
She went on about it for a while. Cassie believes in real things like people and animals. She’s
not exactly a big fan of technology."


god.

yes. plz hip 90s teens. tell me more about cookies.

can you imagine if they knew about ip addresses? 

OH! 

right i remember this one.

doesn't visser three's estranged twin brother  run this site to catch actual human controllers to canibalize them?

.........

that makes even less sense in context, just so we're clear

animorphs sure is a thing

the reason i remembered the plot is the mix of true and false facts about yeerks.  as i recall its a test to weed out the 'fake' yeerk knowers, and the real controllers trying to figure out who the hell is posting their secrets

"“A ‘mix of truth and lies’ is like the definition of the Internet,” Rachel said. “Equal parts reality
and delusion.”"

god yes she gets it. Zampanio!

welp, that's going into the password pile.


see, and now you know how at least SOME of the passwords are created

Have I mentioned how much I hate that Ax can just hack any computer because his species is sooooo advanced? Like maybe if there was some hand wavey "my cybernetics have all knowledge ever and can brute force shit quickly" except as far as we know he doens't HAVE cybernetics. its presented as like. once you know how to do calculus addition is easy.  Except its the OPPOSITE of that for coding. The more you're used to tool chains and frameworks the harder raw code is. And then you add on all the various paradigms that can exist, even BEYOND the literally alien architecture he is having to deal with.

0/10

also sure, fine, marcos computer is hack proof now. but what about the router? the modem? does ax know those things exist? the PHONE LINES? ;laksjd;flja;ldjf

also! and i promise to drop this soon. He "typed in a code"

like its  a password or something.

;asjf

"If you’ve never seen a computer chat room before, it’s kind of confusing. It’s like a conversation
between people who aren’t really listening to each other.
"

you don't say.

and wait, only 10 words. was it really like that? see, yes, i lived back then, but i actually didn't have a computer while reading animorphs. i didn't have one on my own till highschool (its how i made my old angelfire site)

Okay.

ACTUALLY this is the best possible book to cover for the first (only) instance of my personal lil book club?

I'm just sitting here, coming through the chat, tryng to figure out who is a controller, who is human, who is RIGHT about knowing controllers, and who is the fucking visser 3 twin brother guy.

it feels very zampanio, is all i'm saying

I think YrkH8er is the twin. ALSO I don't think tiny me realized that was meant to be pronounced "yeerk hater"
I wasn't exposed to l337 until highschool at LEAST.

god gump sounds like a kid and the fact that they're reaching out for help and being told by an authority figure to TELL their dad they think he's an alien...

okay yeah v zampanio holy shit

its so horsehoes this was the book we ended just before


Apparently andalites invented computers before books. i'm FASCINATED to figure out how that happened.

tho...given they're telepaths with nearly immortal telepathic trees... maybe long term information storage just didn't NEED to be a technology to them for most of their civilization.

i do always appreciate how ALIEN andalites are.

oh NOW Ax can't just auto-magic hack his way in? Are you guys SURE you should be trusting him to "hack-proof" marco's computer? 

Even money he is just bullshitting to look good in front of the humans

how. how do you hack a computer to make sure it "wins ever game online"

what would that even mean? 

did he just
drop a game ai onto the computer to cheat for marco?

why would he do that

hell what online games can you even PLAY in 1998?

Sadly, tho, its time to sleep.  Tomorrow I might read more, I'm about a fifth of the way through and MOST of the time was me rambling here.
