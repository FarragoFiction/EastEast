YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!  Mosquito book mosquito book!

 I don't remember the PLOT so much as every time Ax mentions the fact that doing a tiny morph puts a helpless bag of guts and meat into zspace where it could, in THEORY, get hit by a space ship just always reminds me of this book.


 I remember it just absolutely side swiping me as a kid. Little plausible mission which obviously will spiral out of control turns into SPACE ADVENTURE.

 Man, I didn't even remember it was from Ax's pov.

 Makes sense tho.
